# Hotel Analytics Project

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze hotel booking data to extract valuable insights into booking patterns, hotel performance, and customer behavior. The analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of various metrics and trends related to hotel bookings, aiding in strategic decision-making.

## Data Types
- **Booking Records**: Detailed information about individual bookings, including booking platforms and room categories.
- **Hotel Details**: Information about hotels, such as categories and locations.
- **Room Details**: Information about room categories and their attributes.
- **Aggregated Bookings**: Summary statistics and metrics related to bookings.

## Technology Utilization

### Libraries Required

To conduct the analysis, the following libraries were utilized:

1. **Pandas**
   - For data manipulation and analysis, including reading, transforming, and summarizing datasets.

2. **Matplotlib**
   - For creating visualizations and plots to represent data insights.

3. **NumPy**
   - For numerical operations and handling array-based data.

## Analysis Process

### Data Exploration
1. **Initial Data Reading**
   - Data was loaded from CSV files into Pandas DataFrames for exploration and validation.

2. **Data Inspection**
   - The structure, size, and initial records of the datasets were examined to understand their contents.

### Data Analysis

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - EDA was performed to uncover trends, patterns, and key statistics from the data.
   - Descriptive statistics and visualizations were generated to understand booking trends, hotel performance, and room utilization.

2. **Data Aggregation**
   - Data was aggregated to compute summary metrics such as total bookings per hotel category, average booking values, and booking trends over time.

### Insights and Findings

1. **Booking Trends**
   - Trends in booking volumes across different platforms and times were identified, highlighting peak booking periods and popular platforms.

2. **Hotel Performance**
   - Performance metrics by hotel category and location were analyzed, revealing insights into which categories perform better and which cities have higher booking volumes.

3. **Room Utilization**
   - The distribution of room categories and their utilization rates were examined, providing insights into room preferences and availability.
